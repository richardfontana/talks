The State of Open Source Licensing
==================================

Open source licenses provide the basic legal tools used by developers
to overcome barriers to collaboration and improvement imposed by
copyright law. This talk will give an overview of some of the more
interesting legal issues around the current state of open source
licensing.

We will address the purported decline of the GPL and copyleft, the
apparent trend of 'post-open source software' (public source
repositories with no explicit license), the use of open source
licenses to deal with software patents, and the controversy over
projects requiring contributions to be made under non-open-source
CLAs.
