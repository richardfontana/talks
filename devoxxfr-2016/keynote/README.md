Software development, responsibility and ethics: the coming crisis
==================================================================

As we the transition to an internet of things society where software
pervades all aspects of our lives, the consequences of faulty software
are becoming more critical. There will be growing attention on who
should be held accountable for harm caused by badly-designed code.

We will take a look at the near future of legal responsibility in
software development. Will we see new, restrictive liability regimes
imposed on IT vendors? Will individual developers be held criminally
responsible for introducing bugs? Or can developers seize the
initiative through codes of ethics and through technical solutions?
