The decline of the GPL, and what to do about it
===============================================

This was the third version of this talk that I gave. The first was at
the first FOSDEM Legal Issues DevRoom earlier in 2012. The second was
a presentation I gave to the Linux Foundation member counsel just
prior to the Collab Summit.

A recording of this talk was provided on the Free as in Freedom
oggcast episode 0x29: http://faif.us/cast/2012/may/22/0x29/
(with commentary by Bradley and Karen).
