Contribution Policies for Open Source Projects
==============================================

These are the slides for a talk I gave at LinuxCon on 12 August, 2010.

I believe this is the first talk I gave on CLAs and such and contains
the first use of the phrase "inbound=outbound" in this context.

The talk was given less than two months after Canonical
[launched](http://opensource.com/law/10/6/project-harmony-looks-improve-contribution-agreements-0)
Project Harmony. I had attended at least one Project Harmony meeting
prior to this talk. To some degree the talk signified my taking a more
critical stance with respect to Harmony.
