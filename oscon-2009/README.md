Improving Legal Certainty in FOSS
=================================

These slides were for [my first OSCON
talk](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8460),
given on 23 July 2009 in San Jose.

Slide 15 is notable in hinting at my struggle over the contributor
agreement issue.

Karen Sandler and Bradley Kuhn interviewed me about the subject matter
of this talk in the "Fontana Redux"
[episode](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/podcast/2010/jan/05/0x1E/)
of the *Software Freedom Law Show*.
