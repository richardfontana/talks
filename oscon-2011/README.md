Contributor Agreements Considered Harmful
=========================================

This talk was given at OSCON 2011 on 28 July 2011.

A recording of the talk is available from the Free as in Freedom
oggcast website: http://faif.us/cast/2011/aug/30/0x17/

I recall that there was a bright projector light shining directly in
my eyes during the talk, and I was experiencing something that felt
like a migraine headache. The discomfort I was experiencing might be
evident in the recording.
