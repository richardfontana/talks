Improving the Open Source Legal System
======================================

These are the slides for a talk I gave at SCaLE 8x on Sunday, 21
February 2010.

LWN.net published an [article](https://lwn.net/Articles/375940/)
covering this talk as well as talks given by Karen Sandler and Bradley
Kuhn at the same conference.
